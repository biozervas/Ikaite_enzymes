# Ikaite_enzymes
Mining of an ikaite column metagenome for putative cold active enzymes.

This repository is part of the Coldzymes project awarded to Scientist Mariane Schmidt Th√∏gersen (mst@envs.au.dk) (DFF Coldzymes 0217-00052B).

A metagenomic assembly (described elsewhere) was mined for potential genes encoding cold active enzymes relevant to the detergent industry. The identified enzymes (submitted to NCBI) were codon optimized for heterologous expression in E. coli. The codon optimized nucleotide sequences can be found in this repository under the Codon_optimized_enzyme_gene_sequences_ikaite_metagenome.fasta file.
